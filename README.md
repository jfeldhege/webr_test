# Testing webR functionality in Quarto documents

[webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) allows running R in the browser without a server in the background executing the code.

With the [quarto-webr extension](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr), this functionality is also available in Quarto documents. 

The Quarto document with my experiments is hosted here: http://www.johannesfeldhege.de/webr_test/
