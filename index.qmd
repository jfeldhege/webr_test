## WebR Code Cell
Editing the content of webR code cells and clicking Run Code changes the output. 
```{webr-r}
fit = lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)

summary(fit)
```

## Plots
With webR, code output is not limited to text but can also include plots. 

```{webr-r}
plot(as.factor(mtcars$cyl), mtcars$mpg)

```

## Non-base packages

You can install cran packages by including them in the yaml definition or by calling `webr::install()`. For this page I have already installed the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages.
ÃŒnstalled packages can be loaded with `library()`.
```{webr-r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

mtcars %>% 
  add_rownames("make") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg, label = make)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(hjust = 0, nudge_x = 0.05, check_overlap = TRUE)

```
